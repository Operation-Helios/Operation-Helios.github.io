					<p>Operation Helios was started in 2010 by Liam McBride-Kelly and Riccardo M.M. At the beginning of this project we were both 13, with little electronics experience. Over two years we built our knowledge, eventually launching a balloon in April 2012 from Tamworth, NSW. Helios 1 was quite a simple craft, consisting of a camera, three tracking systems and an emergency cut down system.  After Helios 1 the team put the project on hold, taking some time to explore other ventures.</p>
					<p>After an eight month break from ballooning, we came back together in January 2013. Helios 2 saw a new addition to the team, Leon Shen, while Riccardo M.M moved away from Helios, directing his energy into other passions. The intention with Helios 2 is to take our knowledge from Helios 1 and apply it to a far more complex system. We are attempting to capture seamless panoramic video from the stratosphere, a feat that no other group we know of has achieved. Helios 2 is currently in its final stages of development. We expect to launch in September 2013.</p>
