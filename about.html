					<p>Operation Helios was started in 2010 by Liam McBride-Kelly and Riccardo Miceli Mcmillan. At the beginning of this project, we were both 13, with little electronics experience. We built our knowledge over two years, eventually launching a weather balloon in April 2012 from Tamworth, New South Wales. Helios 1 was quite a simple craft, consisting of a camera, three tracking systems and an emergency cut down system. After Helios 1, we put the project on hold, taking some time to have a rest and catch up with life.</p>
					<p>After an eight month break, we came back together in January 2013. Helios 2 saw a new addition to the team, Leon Shen, while Riccardo Miceli Mcmillan moved away from Helios, exploring other projects.</p>
					<p>The intention with Helios 2 is to apply our knowledge from Helios 1 to a more complex system. We are attempting to capture seamless panoramic video from the stratosphere, a feat that we have not heard achieved. Helios 2 is in the final stages of development, and is expected to launch in September 2013.</p>
